# LM-QR03: My First LLM Model

## Introduction
LM-QR03 is my first attempt at building a transformer-based language model for text generation. It is a small but complex AI model designed to learn and generate human-like text. This project serves as a foundational step in my journey of developing and training LLMs.

## Features
- Transformer-based architecture (GPT-like model)
- Trained on a curated dataset for meaningful text generation
- Lightweight and optimized for training on a laptop
- Capable of basic text completion and content generation

## Installation
To set up LM-QR03 on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Albertburney/LM-QR03
   cd LM-QR03
   ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```sh
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate   # On Windows use: env\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Training the Model
To train the model on your dataset:
```sh
python train.py --epochs 5 --batch_size 16 --learning_rate 5e-5
```
Modify the parameters as needed for better performance.

## Running the Model
Once trained, you can generate text using:
```sh
python generate.py --prompt "Hello, world!"
```

## Future Plans
- Improve training efficiency
- Experiment with different transformer architectures
- Optimize for better performance on limited hardware
